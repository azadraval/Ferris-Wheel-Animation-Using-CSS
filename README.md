# Ferris Wheel Animation Project

This is my Ferris wheel animation project, created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. I built an animated Ferris wheel using CSS animations and transforms to create an engaging visual element.

## Project Overview

The Ferris Wheel project helped me learn how to create complex animations with CSS. By implementing rotation animations and transformations, I created a Ferris wheel with spinning cabins that change colors, demonstrating the power of CSS for creating engaging visual effects.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:
- Creating CSS animations with @keyframes
- Implementing rotation transforms
- Working with animation timing functions
- Setting animation duration and iteration count
- Positioning elements precisely with CSS
- Using transform-origin to control rotation points
- Creating color transitions within animations
- Building geometric shapes with CSS
- Using nth-of-type selectors for specific styling
- Coordinating multiple animations simultaneously

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with animations and transforms)

## Project Structure

- `main.html` - The HTML structure with the Ferris wheel elements
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that creates the animations and visual appearance

## Design Elements

The Ferris wheel animation features:
- A circular wheel that rotates continuously
- Six cabins that counter-rotate as the wheel spins
- Color-changing cabins with smooth transitions
- Spokes that divide the wheel into equal sections
- Carefully positioned elements for realistic movement
- Smooth animation with appropriate timing
- Responsive sizing that works on different screens
- Independent animations that work together cohesively

This project was particularly fun because it showed me how CSS animations can create complex, interactive visuals without JavaScript. I enjoyed the mathematical aspects of positioning the cabins and coordinating the counter-rotations to create a realistic Ferris wheel motion.
